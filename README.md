# Assembly Lab Works

This repository contains my laboratory works for the Assembly course. All related lecture materials can be found in the `lectures` folder. The work was done using DosBOX and IDA.

## Lab List

| Lab | Title | Description |
| --- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1   | **Hello World in Assembly** | A simple program that prints "Hello World!" to the screen. |
| 2   | **EXE Files and DOS I/O** | Basics of EXE file structure, segment management, and input-output using DOS interrupts. |
| 3   | **Multi-module Programs** | Introduction to writing modular assembly programs. |
| 4   | **Matrix Rotation** | A program to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise. |
| 5   | **16-bit Number Processing** | A menu-driven program to input a 16-bit number and display it in signed and unsigned form, using multiple modules and function pointers. |
| 6   | **Interrupt Handling and Resident Programs** | A resident DOS program that dynamically changes keyboard input speed in cycles every second. |
| 7   | **x86/x86-64 String Handling** | A C/C++ program that calls two assembly routines: one for string length calculation and another for copying strings with possible memory overlap. |
| 8   | **Math Coprocessor** | Examines floating-point operation speed and precision, comparing results for sin(π) and sin(π/2), and solving an equation root. |
| 9   | **x86 Instruction Set Extensions** | Matrix multiplication using AVX or SSE processor extensions, with dynamic input sizes. |
| 10  | **Graphical User Interface Program** | A GUI-based application for finding equation roots, with input fields for initial data and a result display. |
| 11  | **Low-level Windows/Linux Programming** | Reverse engineering with tools like x64dbg and IDA to find the password needed for displaying the message "congrats you cracked the password". |

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **DosBOX**: For running assembly programs in DOS environment.
- **IDA**: For reverse engineering and debugging.
- **AVX/SSE**: x86-64 instruction set extensions.
